Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

Contributions to this project are [released](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license) to the public under the project's open source license.

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codinasion/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork the repository.](https://github.com/codinasion/codinasion/fork)
2. Clone the forked repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/codinasion
   ```

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
   ```

4. Make changes locally.

   - Add new features
   - Fix bugs
   - Improve documentation, code quality, performance, accessibility, user experience, user interface, etc...

5. Commit your changes.

   Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Make sure to add a descriptive commit message.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

6. Create a pull request.

   When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

   - Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
   - Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
   - Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
   - Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
   - We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
   - As you update your PR and apply changes, [mark each conversation as resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
   - If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow standards for style and code quality.
- Write tests.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
