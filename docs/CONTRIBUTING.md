# Welcome to Codinasion contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [codinasion.org][1] and its subdomains :sparkles:.

Read our [Code of Conduct][2] to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README][3]. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub][4]
- [Set up Git][5]
- [GitHub flow][6]
- [Collaborating with pull requests][7]

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you want to add or modify Codinasion content, [search if an issue already exists][9]. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue template][10].

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues][11] to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.

2. Clone the forked repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/codinasion
   ```

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
   ```

4. Make changes locally.

   - Add new features
   - Fix bugs
   - Improve documentation, code quality, performance, accessibility, user experience, user interface, etc...

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Make sure to add a descriptive commit message.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue][12] if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits][13] so the branch can be updated for a merge.
  Once you submit your PR, a Codinasion team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes][14] or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved][15].
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial][16] to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged

Congratulations :tada::tada: The Codinasion team thanks you :sparkles:

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [codinasion.org][1]
