Multiply the first hexit by 16^0.\r\n2. Multiply the second hexit by 16^1.\r\n3. Multiply the third hexit by 16^2.\r\n4. Multiply the fourth hexit by 16^3.\r\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the last hexit.\r\n6. Add the results of all the multiplications.\r\n7. The decimal number is the sum of all the multiplications.\r\n\r\n```\r\nInput  : A\r\nOutput : 10\r\n```\n",
