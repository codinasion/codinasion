## Write a program to find power of a number by recursion

Power of a number is calculated by multiplying the number by itself for the given number of times. For example, 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.

Power of a number can be calculated by recursion. The formula is:

```math
x^n = x * x^{n-1}
```

```txt
Input  : 2 3
Output : 8
```
