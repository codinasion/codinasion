## Write a program to find sum of digits of a number by recursion

Suppose we have a number `n` and we want to find the sum of its digits. For example, if `n = 123`, then the sum of its digits is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

Recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In this case, we can use recursion to find the sum of digits of a number.

```txt
Input  : 123
Output : 6
```
