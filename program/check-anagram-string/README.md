## Write a program to check Anagram strings

Two strings are said to be anagrams if they make a meaningful word by rearranging or shuffling the letters of the string. In other words, we can say that two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters but in different order.

```txt
Input  : pan, nap
Output : Anagram Strings
```
