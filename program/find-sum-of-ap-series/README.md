## Write a program to find sum of ap series

An arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two consecutive terms is a constant. The nth term of an AP is given by the formula a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + (n-1)d where a<sub>1</sub> is the first term and d is the common difference.
