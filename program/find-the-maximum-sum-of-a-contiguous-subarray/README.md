## Write a program to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray

Maximum subarray problem is the task of finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum. For example, for the sequence of values `−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4;` the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is `4, −1, 2, 1,` with sum `6`.

```
Input  : [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]
Output : 7
```
