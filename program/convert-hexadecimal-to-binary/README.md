## Write a program to convert hexadecimal to binary

Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system. It uses sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. The digits are called hexits. A hexit is the smallest unit of information in a computer. A hexit can be used to represent a single value, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, or F, or it can be used to represent a single state, such as on or off.

Binary is a base-2 number system. It uses only two digits: 0 and 1. The digits are called bits. A bit is the smallest unit of information in a computer. A bit can be either 0 or 1. A bit can be used to represent a single value, such as 0 or 1, or it can be used to represent a single state, such as on or off.

To convert a hexadecimal number to binary, we can use the following algorithm:

1. Convert the hexadecimal number to decimal.
2. Convert the decimal number to binary.

```
Input  : A
Output : 1010
```
