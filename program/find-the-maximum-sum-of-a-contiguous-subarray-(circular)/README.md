## Write a program to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray (circular)

Maximum sum of a circular subarray is the task of finding the contiguous subarray within a circular one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum. For example, for the sequence of values `10, -3, -4, 7, 6, 5, -4, -1;` the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is `7, 6, 5,` with sum `18`.
