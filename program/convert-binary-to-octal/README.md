## Write a program to convert binary to octal

Binary is a base-2 number system. It uses only two digits: 0 and 1. The digits are called bits. A bit is the smallest unit of information in a computer. A bit can be either 0 or 1. A bit can be used to represent a single value, such as 0 or 1, or it can be used to represent a single state, such as on or off.

Octal is a base-8 number system. It uses only eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The digits are called octits. An octit is the smallest unit of information in a computer. An octit can be used to represent a single value, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, or it can be used to represent a single state, such as on or off.

To convert a binary number to octal, we can use the following algorithm:

1. Convert the binary number to decimal.
2. Convert the decimal number to octal.

```
Input  : 1010
Output : 12
```
