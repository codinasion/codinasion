## Write a program to find sum of gp series

A geometric progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. The nth term of a GP is given by the formula a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1</sub>r<sup>n-1</sup> where a<sub>1</sub> is the first term and r is the common ratio.
