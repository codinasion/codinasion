## Write a program to calculate the combination of n objects taken r at a time

Combination is a selection of objects from a group such that (unlike permutations) the order of selection does not matter. The number of combinations on n objects taken r at a time is given by the formula n!/(r!(n-r)!) = n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-r+1)/r!
