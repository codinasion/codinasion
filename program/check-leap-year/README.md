## Write a program to check leap year

Leap years are years that are divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless they are also divisible by 400. For example, 1996 is a leap year, but 1900 is not. Write a function that takes a year as a parameter and returns True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.

```txt
Input  : 2016
Output : Leap Year
```
