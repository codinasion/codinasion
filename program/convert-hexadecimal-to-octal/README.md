## Write a program to convert hexadecimal to octal

Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system. It uses sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. The digits are called hexits. A hexit is the smallest unit of information in a computer. A hexit can be used to represent a single value, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, or F, or it can be used to represent a single state, such as on or off.

Octal is a base-8 number system. It uses only eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The digits are called octits. An octit is the smallest unit of information in a computer. An octit can be used to represent a single value, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, or it can be used to represent a single state, such as on or off.

To convert a hexadecimal number to octal, we can use the following algorithm:

1. Convert the hexadecimal number to decimal.
2. Convert the decimal number to octal.
