## Write a program to convert decimal to binary

Binary is a base-2 number system. It uses only two digits: 0 and 1. The digits are called bits. A bit is the smallest unit of information in a computer. A bit can be either 0 or 1. A bit can be used to represent a single value, such as 0 or 1, or it can be used to represent a single state, such as on or off.

To convert a decimal number to binary, we can use the following algorithm:

1. Divide the decimal number by 2.
2. Write down the remainder.
3. Divide the quotient by 2.
4. Write down the remainder.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the quotient is 0.
6. The binary number is the sequence of remainders written in reverse order.
