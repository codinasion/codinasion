## Write a program to convert string to sentencecase

Sentence case is a style of writing in which the first letter of the first word is capitalized, while all other letters are in lowercase. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, proper nouns (such as names of people, places, organizations, etc.) and acronyms (such as NASA, FBI, etc.) should always be capitalized, regardless of their position in the sentence. The first word after a colon or a semicolon may also be capitalized.

Here is an example of a sentence in sentence case: "**`The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.`**" In this sentence, only the first letter of the first word is capitalized, while all other letters are in lowercase.

However, if the sentence contains proper nouns or acronyms, they should also be capitalized. For example: "**`John and Jane went to New York to visit the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).`**" In this sentence, the first letter of the first word, as well as the proper nouns "John", "Jane", "New York", and "Museum of Modern Art", and the acronym "MoMA" are capitalized.

Here are some examples of converting strings to sentence cases:

Example 1:

```txt
Input  : "john and jane went to new york to visit the museum of modern art (moma)"
Output : "John and Jane went to New York to visit the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)"
```

Example 2:

```txt
Input  : "the united nations (un) is an international organization"
Output : "The United Nations (UN) is an international organization"
```

Example 3:

```txt
Input  : "the cat is sleeping; however, the dog is awake"
Output : "The cat is sleeping; however, the dog is awake"
```
