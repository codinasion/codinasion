## :mega: Discussions

Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing, join us in [discussions][6].

## :lady_beetle: Issues

[Issues][2] are used to track tasks that contributors can help with.

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search `open issues` to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a [template][7]. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests

A [pull request][8] is a way to suggest changes in our repository.

When we merge those changes, they should be deployed to the live site within 24 hours :earth_africa:
